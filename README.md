## Disclaimer

- This is my personal repository to keep track of my progress all in one place
- My code might not be best practices since I'm still new to coding and self-taught
- Codewars discourages the creation of this type of repositories since Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at your solutions until they have completed it
